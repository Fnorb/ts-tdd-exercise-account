# TDD Account System

A small practice project to apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) using TypeScript, Node.js, and Vitest.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This project demonstrates how to build a simple account system using the principles of Test-Driven Development. Each feature is developed using the TDD cycle: writing a failing test (Red), implementing the minimal code to pass it (Green), and then improving the code (Refactor).

## ðŸ§© Features (planned / partially implemented)

- âœ… Create an account
- âœ… View current balance
- âœ… Deposit money
- âœ… Withdraw money (with sufficient balance check)
- ðŸ”„ Daily withdrawal limit (e.g., max 1000â‚¬)
- ðŸ”„ Track transaction history
- ðŸ§ª 100% test coverage with Vitest
- ðŸš§ Designed for easy extensibility (e.g. transfers, interest, etc.)

## ðŸ§ª Tech Stack

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing

## ðŸš€ Running the Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
